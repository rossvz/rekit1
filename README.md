# README

This project utilizes an opinionated development environment for react called "Rekit".

After cloning: 

`npm install`

`npm start`

This will start the webpack config like normal at `localhost:6065`

The cool part of this project is that it will also create an editor IDE at `localhost:6076`.

This allows us to create new features/components/redux actions/tests etc. from within the browser. I believe its based on VS Code's editor engine.
